# The Quest For The Golden Bug
My entry for Game Off 2021, built with Inform7 designed to run with interpreters using the old-school Infocom Z-Machine format.

You'll require an Inform7 compatible Z-Machine interpreter to play this natively on PC/Mac/Linux/DOS, here is a handy list, I personally use Gargoyle: http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/

List of Z-Machine interpreters: https://ifwiki.org/index.php/List_of_Z-machine_interpreters

To view the project files and code, you'll require a copy of Inform7 itself: http://inform7.com/

Maps, hints, and the winning solution can be found in the 'feelies' directory, these should be printer-friendly if you want the full old-school Infocom feel, but can work just as well on the computer as well! 

Hope you have as much fun playing as I did making it!
